# Password Generator

this is a simple code with rust I created this for my practic.
This code can generate a password with random characters without any logic.

## Build & Run

you can build this project like:

``` cargo build ```

and after that you can run like this:

``` cd target/debug && ./password_generator ```

or you can set your own length of password with -l or --length argument:

``` ./password_generator -l 20 ```
